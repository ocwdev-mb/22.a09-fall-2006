  caption: Details of dislocation emission in molecular dynamics simulation of a metal
    thin film under nanoindentation. For clarity only the "defective" atoms are displayed,
    each is color coded according to the number of its neighbors. (Most of the atoms
    in the simulation are essentially not perturbed by the indentation and therefore
    not shown.) (Image courtesy of Ju Li. Used with permission.)
